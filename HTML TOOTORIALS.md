#**HTML** Real Quick ***START UP GUIDE***

- *Welcome* to a run through of HTML from the very beginning.
- This tutorial will bring you through, steps by step, the basics of HTML.

---
##**STEP ONE** - Get a text editor

**Text editors** is what we use to type are **code** them most efficient way.  
 Go get one.

- I would recommend either [**Sublime**](https://www.sublimetext.com/3). or [**NotePad++**](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.2.html). if you are on **windows**.

- Or if you are on a **Chromebook** I would used [**Caret**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/caret/fljalecfjciodhpcledpamjachpmelml).

You can technically use note for windows if you want its just these text editors make life a lot simpler **`AND THEY ARE COLOUR CODED.`**

When you install them you are ready for the **next Step**.

---

##**STEP TWO** - Creating a **HTML** File

Open up your brand new text editor and create a blank file.

- Now save the file as **`index.html`**. Do this by pressing `CTRL + S`
(NOTE: it does not matter what you call it as long as it ends in .HTML)

Know We can start coding, type this in the file you have created:

```sh
<!DOCTYPE: html> 
```

- This tells the computer that the Document (DOCTYPE) you are making is a html file. 

---
###**STEP TWO.5** - Testing the file

A little mini lesson on test your file 

- Save it by doing `CTRL + S` (Do this often) 

- Drag the index.html file (or whatever you called it) into your browser. 

You will know be gifted with a new tab with nothing in it.
This is your website.

- This means you are doing great and everything is working.
- If something did appear on your screen when loading the website it means your computer is hunted, please call for help.

For know on after doing a small change to your code, check it each time, plz
(refresh the page by pressing `CTRL + R`).

---
##**STEP THREE** - adding code structure.

This is the frame of your website:
```sh
<html>                                      
	<head>
			
	</head>
		
	<body>
			
	</body>
</html>
```
- You just created 3 tags in Html. Each word in between the <> is know as a tag.
- `<tag>` starts the tag and `</tag>` ends the tag, each one has their own special name. 

- Each Tag will get their own mini step, COS I SAID SO:

---
###**STEP THREE.333** - `<html>` tag


- The `<html>` tag will contain the entire website (besides the DOCTYPE bit).
- It starts at `<html>` and ends at `</html>`. Everything in between in apart of the website.

---
###**STEP THREE.*666*** - `<head>` tag

Things that need to be loaded in **BEFORE** the website appears in from of you goes into the `<head>`tag.

- type this in between the two `<head></head>` :


	<title> A GREAT WEBSITE</title>


The <Title> is the name you give your website that will appear in the tab bar above, you see? 

- Test it out. (by dragging the html file into the browser, make sure to save the file before).

The `<head>` section can have many things in it such as: *links to other code, types of font, CSS* we will get to them in the future.

---
###**STEP THREE.*999*** - `<body>` tag

This by far the best and most important tag. 

- The `<body>` tag contains everything view-able on the website.
	- Take down this example *INSIDE* the `<body>`:
	
```sh
<h1>Welcome, to THIS GREAT WEBSITE</h1>
	
<p>Isn't Ciaran just the best.</p>
```

- Now test out your website, did you get the text on the website, I bet you did. 

- The `<h1>`(**header**) and `<p>`(**paragraph**) are more tags that add text to your website with their own attributes . 
- The `<h1>`(Header) creates Text in big size for the header of a website. 
- Anything between `<h1></h1>` becomes the header.
(you can also have h2, h3...etc for smaller headers)

- The `<p>`(paragaph) makes text appear in a fairly small size for paragraphs.

These tags inside the body make up most of the structure of your website.

- There is an insane amount of these **tags** for all sort of customising.

- I would recamend messing around with these and learning more off [w3schools](http://www.w3schools.com/html/) school.
- Now that you *know the basics* you can experiment freely.
- They have a giant collection of **examples** for you to try. NOW GO!
